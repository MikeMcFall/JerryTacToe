# JerryTacToe
An OOP class project written by myself and Tyler Meadows.
This game is similar to Tic Tac Toe, except for when played optimally, the player who goes first should always win. 
To build the AI, I started with one built to play Tic Tac Toe, and then modified it to follow the new rules.
The board was largely designed and implemented by Tyler.
